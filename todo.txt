1. Add graph presentation of the log files!
2. Record first log file
3. Create a linear regression model with the lowest r-factor, and then ask for the
year / date where the player started playing minecraft
4. Do integral-calculations to estimate the total area beneath the expression, et voila, we got an
estimate of the total playtime since the person started playing minecraft - even without
the full minecraft log history / all the worlds!
